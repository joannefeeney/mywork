Look at the program above:
a. What will be printed out when this program is run?
b. What would you have to add to the program to get it to print out what
the calling the function yo(3) returns?
'''

'''
a. I think 6 will be printed when this program is run
b. Do not understand the question but if it is asked what needs to be added to the program 
  for an answer to be seen then: print(f"(yo(3))")

print(yo(3))
